# TaskZoo - Flutter Mobile Application
TaskZoo is a delightful Flutter mobile application designed to make task management fun and engaging. With an Isar-powered backend, it offers an intuitive way for users to track and complete their tasks. As users complete tasks, they slowly build up a beautiful animal SVG, turning mundane tasks into a playful, artistic endeavor.
